# JWT Single Sign-on System

Playing around with JWT and Oauth2. bootstrapped with [ankur-anand/simple-sso](https://github.com/ankur-anand/simple-sso).

I have modified the provided boilerplate to use mongoDB as a database for caching tokens, sessions, users, and clients.

TODO:

* Document stuff
  * UI for adding clients
  * Explanation on how to implement new clients
  * etc...
* Make implementation easier for clients
* Build statistics and tracking stuff

Refer to setup.md for further instruction and configuration.
