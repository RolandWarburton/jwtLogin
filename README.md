# JWT Login system

Playing around with JWT and Oauth2. bootstrapped with [ankur-anand/simple-sso](https://github.com/ankur-anand/simple-sso).

I have modified the provided boilerplate to use mongoDB as a database for caching tokens, sessions, users, and clients.

TODO:

* Evaluate the need to use the tokenCache
* Add logout functionality

Refer to setup.md for further instruction and configuration.
